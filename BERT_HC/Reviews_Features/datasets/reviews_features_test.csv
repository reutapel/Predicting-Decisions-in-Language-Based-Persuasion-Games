Negative: The hotel allows people to be with their pets. One of the guests left his 2 big dogs in the room and went outside. We were obliged to change the room around 11 pm simply because the hotel weren't able to join the guest by phone. When we asked the concierge about the way the accept people with pets the answer was they are paying extra money for this. This was a ridiculous justification from the hotel. Adding to that there is an adhoc market every. Tuesday. Friday. Sunday in front of the hotel from 5 am until 3 pm with the noise and the dust everywhere in the road ",1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
